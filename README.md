# Clean HungerGames

A clean version of the hunger games simulator by adrian-thumbtack!
By clean I mean it has less inappropriate stuff and no badwords!
For all those people who wanted it!

About:
Hunger Games Simulator 2.0! The code is now a little less difficult to read and the website has a much better design now, both thanks to Eric Zheng. Health points have now been added, hopefully to be updated soon. For now, have fun whacking people with a dead platypus!
